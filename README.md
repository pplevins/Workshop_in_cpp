# Workshop in C++

This course covers advanced topics in programming, development in an object-oriented environment (OOP), and implementing the learned data structures in C++. As part of the course, I learned the principles of Object-Oriented Programming, and learned about libraries and classes defined in the C++ environment.

# Topics:

1. Object-Oriented Programming - Introduction
2. Constructor and Destructor functions
3. Operator overloading
4. C++ string class
5. Friend Class and Function
6. Exception handling
7. Static functions and variables
8. Binary files
9. Data structure implementation: vector, list, stack, queue, and tree
10. Inheritance
11. Virtual classes
12. Abstract classes
13. Polymorphism
14. Template metaprogramming (TMP)
15. C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
16. Anonymous function (Lambda)
17. Bitwise operations and Bit manipulation
